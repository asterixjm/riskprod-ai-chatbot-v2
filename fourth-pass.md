Below is my point-by-point response to the reviewer’s concerns, showing where I agree, where I disagree, and how each item should be handled in the prototype timeline.

| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| **1. “Conversational UX undefined / no correction workflow.”**      | **Agree (partially).** We’ve already inserted a **Review & Edit sidebar** into the MVP scope, which lets users inspect and tweak the generated graph before running. That covers the “escape-hatch” the reviewer wants. A separate drag-and-drop editor is heavier; we should **defer** that to Phase 2 unless the sidebar proves insufficient. |                   |                          |
| **2. One-shot vs. iterative LLM calls could be slow/expensive.**    | **Agree.** Runtime cost is bounded because the sidebar means we need only **one** Claude call per scenario (the first translation). Subsequent tweaks are local JSON edits—no more LLM tokens. We’ll add that clarification to the doc.                                                                                                         |                   |                          |
| **3. Order of operations for multiple risk edges (absolute vs %).** | **Strongly agree.** Determinism is vital. **Action:** add `priority` (integer) to the edge schema; lower number = applied earlier. Default: percentages after absolutes (safer for most finance scenarios). This is a one-line schema change plus \~20 lines in the engine—well inside MVP.                                                     |                   |                          |
| **4. Per-iteration error handling (div-by-zero, log(-ve)).**        | **Agree.** Engine will wrap each node’s calculation in `try/except`; on error that iteration’s value becomes `NaN` and is excluded from stats. We’ll log a count so users see “9 992 of 10 000 iterations successful.”                                                                                                                          |                   |                          |
| **5. Graph complexity / cognitive overload.**                       | **Agree but defer.** MVP targets <50 nodes. Phase 2 roadmap already has large-graph UX (mini-map, filters, “explain-why”). No change needed now.                                                                                                                                                                                                |                   |                          |
| **6. Translation consistency (synonyms).**                          | **Disagree with synonym tables.** Our philosophy is *AI for first draft + human review*. The sidebar solves mis-translations without bloating prompts. Consistency across wording is desirable but not critical for prototype.                                                                                                                  |                   |                          |
| **7. Correlation between inputs absent.**                           | **Agree in principle; out-of-scope for MVP.** We’ll highlight it as Phase 2 priority. A copula or parent-child sampling link is non-trivial and would delay the prototype.                                                                                                                                                                      |                   |                          |
| **8. AST whitelist vague.**                                         | **Agree.** We will publish the exact MVP list: `+ - * / **`, `abs`, `min`, `max`, `round`, `floor`, `ceil`, `log`, `exp`, and the conditional helper `where(condition, a, b)`. That goes into the doc and the evaluator.                                                                                                                        |                   |                          |

### Net changes to implement now (all within Phase 1)

1. **Add `priority` field to edge schema** (default 0 for absolutes, 10 for percentages) and specify “percentage edges apply after absolutes unless priority overrides.”
2. **Document per-iteration error handling** (catch → mark NaN → discard).
3. **Publish AST function whitelist** in the spec.
4. Clarify that the Review & Edit sidebar eliminates repeated Claude calls.

Everything else (large-graph UX, correlation modelling) remains Phase 2.

If you’re happy with this stance, I’ll update the documentation accordingly.
