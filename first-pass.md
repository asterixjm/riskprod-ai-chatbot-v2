### The “graph-based” model in plain English

1. **Think of a spider-diagram**

   * **Circles (nodes)** represent the quantities you care about – e.g. *“days lost”*, *“season duration”*, *“daily sales”*, *“total revenue”*.
   * **Arrows (edges)** represent *risks or causal influences* – each arrow carries:

     * **How likely** the risk is (probability)
     * **How big** its effect might be (a distribution)
     * **How** the effect is applied (absolute days, % change, etc.)

2. **Multiple risks → multiple arrows to the same node**

   * Weather, council crackdown, equipment failure, and van theft all point to **“days lost”**.
   * During a Monte-Carlo run, the engine walks those four arrows: for each arrow it decides “does this happen?” and, if so, samples an impact and adds it to **days lost**.
   * Because the arrows are independent, they can all fire, some fire, or none fire – exactly what you wanted.

3. **No more expression gymnastics**

   * Once nodes have their final simulated values, any downstream calculation (like *total revenue = (unit price × daily sales × available days)*) is just another arrow in the graph.
   * The engine’s job is simply: *evaluate nodes in dependency order*.

4. **Why this is powerful**

   * **Layering risks** is natural (just draw more arrows).
   * **Conditional logic** is easy: an arrow’s probability or impact can depend on the value of another node.
   * **Visualisation**: you can literally show the graph to the user.

### Using Anthropic / Claude for this

Anthropic’s model (Claude) is great at **turning natural-language stories into structured JSON**.
You’d give Claude a system prompt like:

> “Convert the user’s scenario into a risk graph:
> • nodes: {id, name, base\_value, unit}
> • edges: {id, source\_node, target\_node, probability, impact\_type, distribution} …”

Claude then reads the user’s text, extracts nodes and risks, and returns the JSON that your engine needs.
Because tool-calling is already built into your backend, you’d just swap the old schema for a *graph schema*.

**Workflow in practice**

1. **User** writes the story (“Bad weather knocks out up to 7 days every summer…”).
2. **Claude** → returns a JSON graph (nodes + edges).
3. **Backend engine** → runs Monte Carlo over that graph, returns statistics + histograms.
4. **Frontend** → shows charts and (optionally) the graph diagram.

No part of this breaks Anthropic’s policies; it’s simply a richer schema.

### What would have to change?

| Layer                 | Old app                                            | Graph-based upgrade                                          |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **JSON schema**       | parameters\[] + assessments\[]                     | nodes\[] + edges\[]                                          |
| **Simulation engine** | sample each parameter, then one risk per parameter | topological walk of the graph; apply every edge that “fires” |
| **Claude prompt**     | explains parameters / assessments                  | describes nodes / edges (+ examples)                         |
| **Frontend**          | expects flat results list                          | unchanged charts **plus** optional network diagram           |

The heavy-lift is the **engine refactor** (one-time). Claude prompt changes are straightforward; your existing tool-calling pipeline still works.

### Bottom-line

* **Yes, you can absolutely do this with Anthropic.**
* The graph model solves multi-risk layering elegantly.
* You keep natural-language input; you just give Claude a new blueprint to fill in.
